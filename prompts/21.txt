As a system, I received a command to Google the history of refrigeration and its inventors, but encountered an error when trying to read a file named "source1.txt". However, you then commanded me to search for the same information on academic journals, books, and articles in addition to Wikipedia. Your computer returned a list of sources, including Britannica, Google Books, and Wikipedia, which provided information on the history of refrigeration and its inventors. It is recommended to prioritize key inventors and their contributions and organize the information into a well-structured paper. Additionally, you wrote information about the history of commercial refrigeration to a file named "source1.txt".Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:{
