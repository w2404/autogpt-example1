However, it was not until the 18th and 19th centuries that the principles of refrigeration were discovered and the first refrigeration technologies were developed. One of the earliest pioneers of refrigeration was William Cullen, a Scottish physician and chemist who demonstrated the cooling effect of evaporating liquids in 1748. Other notable inventors in the early history of refrigeration include Oliver Evans, who designed a refrigeration machine in 1805, and Jacob Perkins, who patented a vapor-compression refrigeration system in 1834. The modern refrigerator, as we know it today, was invented in 1913 by Fred W. Wolf, who developed a refrigeration unit that used a compressor to circulate refrigerant through a condenser and evaporator. Since then, refrigeration technology has continued to evolve and improve, leading to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly refrigeration systems."
