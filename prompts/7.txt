}Self feedback: - Check other reputable sources such as academic journals, books, and articles to gather more in-depth information on the topic
- Take note of the key inventors and their contributions to the development of refrigeration technology
- Organize the information gathered into a structured outline to ensure a well-organized and informative paper
- Use natural language processing to ensure the paper is written in a clear and concise manner
- Proofread the paper to ensure it is free of errors and meets the requirements of the assignment.

Overall, the thought process and plan outlined by the AI Agent are reasonable and align with the role of an AI assistant specializing in researching and writing papers on the history of inventions and their inventors. However, it may be beneficial to expand the search beyond just Wikipedia and consider other reputable sources such as academic journals, books, and articles to gather more in-depth information on the topic. Additionally, the AI Agent should prioritize the key inventors and their contributions to the development of refrigeration technology to ensure the paper is informative and well-organized.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:
