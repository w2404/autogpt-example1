As the system, I received two commands from you to write to files named "impact_analysis.txt" and "challenges.txt". The files contained information on the impact and challenges faced by the inventors of the refrigerator. The invention of the refrigerator had a significant impact on society, enabling people to preserve food for longer periods and leading to changes in dietary habits and the growth of the food industry. The inventors faced several challenges, including technical, financial, and social obstacles, but overcame them through innovation, collaboration, and perseverance.Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:{
