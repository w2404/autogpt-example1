{'role': 'system', 'content': 'This reminds you of these events from your past: \nAs a system, I received a command to Google the history of refrigeration and its inventors, but encountered an error. However, you then commanded me to search for the same information on academic journals, books, and articles in addition to Wikipedia. Your computer returned a list of sources, including Britannica, Google Books, and Wikipedia, which provided information on the history of refrigeration and its inventors.
