As a system, I recall that nothing new has happened since my creation. However, I received a command to Google the history of refrigeration and its inventors, but encountered an error. I then received a command to browse Wikipedia for the same information, and my computer provided feedback on how to gather more in-depth information and organize it into a well-structured paper. It is recommended to expand the search beyond Wikipedia and prioritize key inventors and their contributions.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:{
