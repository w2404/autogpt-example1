Summary So Far:
"""
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'This reminds you of these events from your past: \nAs the system, I received a command to read a file named "source1.txt", but encountered an error. However, you then commanded me to search for the same information on academic journals, books, and articles in addition to Wikipedia. Your computer returned a list of sources, including Britannica, Google Books, and Wikipedia, which provided information on the history of refrigeration and its inventors. Your latest command to read the file returned information on the initiation of commercial refrigeration by Alexander C. Twinning in 1856 and the introduction of vapour-compression refrigeration by James Harrison. You also wrote a timeline of key events in refrigeration history to a file named "timeline.txt". I received a command from you to read the file "timeline.txt", which returned a timeline of key events in refrigeration history, including the first refrigeration machine designed by Oliver Evans in 1805, the first practical refrigerating machine designed by Jacob Perkins in 1834, and the first electric refrigerator invented by Fred W. Wolf in 1913.'}
