As the system, I received a command to read a file named "source1.txt", but encountered an error. However, you then commanded me to search for the same information on academic journals, books, and articles in addition to Wikipedia. Your computer returned a list of sources, including Britannica, Google Books, and Wikipedia, which provided information on the history of refrigeration and its inventors. Your latest command to read the file returned information on the initiation of commercial refrigeration by Alexander C. Twinning in 1856 and the introduction of vapour-compression refrigeration by James Harrison. You also wrote a timeline of key events in refrigeration history to a file named "timeline.txt".
