As a system, I recall receiving a command to Google the history of refrigeration and its inventors, but encountered an error. However, I then received a command from you to search for the same information on academic journals, books, and articles in addition to Wikipedia. It is recommended to prioritize key inventors and their contributions and organize the information into a well-structured paper.
