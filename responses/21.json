Social challenges included the resistance of some people to the idea of refrigeration, as they believed that it would lead to the loss of traditional food preservation methods. The inventors overcame these challenges through innovation, collaboration, and perseverance. They developed new technologies, formed partnerships with other inventors and businesses, and educated the public about the benefits of refrigeration.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
